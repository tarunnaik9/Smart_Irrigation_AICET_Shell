##  Smart Irrigation System â€“ Project Description

This project automates crop irrigation using real-time environmental data and machine learning predictions. By analyzing sensor inputs like soil moisture, temperature, and humidity, the system intelligently determines irrigation needs and controls water flow accordingly. A responsive dashboard displays live conditions and alerts users when action is required.

###  Improvisations Done
- Enhanced sensor data accuracy by calibrating input thresholds
- Fine-tuned ML prediction model for improved irrigation decisions
- Improved dashboard layout for clearer visualization
- Integrated notification system to alert users when irrigation is triggered or recommended
